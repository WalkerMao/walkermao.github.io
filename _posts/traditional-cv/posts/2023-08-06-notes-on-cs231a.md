## [1. Camera Models](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231a/course_notes/01-camera-models.pdf)

### 1.2 Pinhole cameras

As the aperture size decreases, the image gets sharper, but darker.

### 1.3 Cameras and lenses

In modern cameras, the above conflict between crispness and brightness is mitigated by using lenses.

A 3D point at further distance in front of the lens result in rays converge to a closer point behind the lens.

Because the paraxial refraction model approximates using the thin lens assumption, a number of aberrations can occur. The most common one is referred to as radial distortion, which causes the image magnification to decrease or increase as a function of the distance to the optical axis. We classify the radial distortion as pincushion distortion when the magnification increases and barrel distortion (e.g. fish-eye lenses) when the magnification decreases. Radial distortion is caused by the fact that different portions of the lens have differing focal lengths.

### 1.4 Going to digital image space
